## Building and running p2-browser locally

As of 2013-11-11, p2-browser Java WebStart Launcher appears to be broken on all recent versions of Java. To build and 
run p2-browser as a standalone RCP application

* Make sure a recent version of JDK is installed and available on PATH
* If you don't already have Maven, download [latest version of Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) and
  untar/unzip it to a local directory
* Clone this git repository locally
* From base directory of the clone run the following command

```
    <path-to-maven-install>/bin/mvn clean package
```

* RCP applications for all enabled platforms will be created under com.ifedorenko.p2browser.rcp/target/products directory.
  Both packed and unpacked versions are created

* To start p2-browser, execute p2browser (or p2browser.exe, if you happen to be on Windows) from the root of RCP app
  for your platform.

## Java WebStart Launcher

On some platforms, p2browser can be started by [following this link](http://ifedorenko.github.com/p2-browser/javaws/com.ifedorenko.p2browser.jnlp).

If the link above does not work, which appear to be the case on some/many Linux distributions, then
p2browser can be started using the following command on command line

    javaws  http://ifedorenko.github.com/p2-browser/javaws/com.ifedorenko.p2browser.jnlp

p2browser uses the proxy configuration from the Java Control Panel. You should configure the 
proxy server manually (option 'Use proxy server') because 'Use browser settings' doesn't work and 
'Use automatic proxy configuration script' is not supported.
